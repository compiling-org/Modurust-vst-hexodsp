# Modurust DAW Documentation

## Overview

Modurust is a revolutionary Rust-based Digital Audio Workstation featuring a unique three-view paradigm that seamlessly combines traditional DAW workflows with live performance capabilities and modular synthesis.

## Key Features

### Three-View System
- **Arrangement View**: Traditional timeline-based production
- **Live View**: Real-time performance with clip matrix
- **Node View**: Visual modular patching interface

### Audio Engine
- Ultra-low latency (<1ms round-trip)
- Real-time audio processing
- Modular node-based architecture
- 8 core audio node types

### MIDI 2.0 & MPE Support
- Full MIDI 2.0 protocol implementation
- MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression)
- Per-note pitch bend and pressure
- Sample-accurate timing

### AI-Powered Tools
- SAI (Sonic AI) for text-to-audio generation
- Stream Diffusion for real-time audio manipulation
- AI Stem Separation for intelligent mixing
- Pattern generation and arrangement analysis
